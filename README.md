# Kidnapped Vehicle Particle Filter Project
This project is originally forked from https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Kidnapped-vehicle-Project. This repository includes starter code, that is used herein.

## Results

The video below was generated by post-processing data in Matlab.  The size of the particles (blue circles) in the second frame is proportional to the number of times a particular particle appears in the total set.  The larger the particle, the more likely the algorithm considers this position to be correct.
