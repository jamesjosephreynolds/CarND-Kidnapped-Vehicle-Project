# Kidnapped Vehicle Particle Filter Project
This project is originally forked from https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Kidnapped-vehicle-Project. This repository includes starter code, that is used herein.

## Particle Filter Initialization

```C++

void ParticleFilter::init(double x, double y, double theta, double std[]) {
  // Visualization for debugging - print initial point
  //std::cout << "Initial data:\n\tx: " << x << "\t y: " << y << "\t theta: " << theta << "\n\n";
  
  // Choose number of particles
  num_particles = 100;
  particles.reserve(num_particles); // Set size of yet-to-be-populated array
  weights.resize(num_particles);
  
  // From lesson 14.4
  // Create random noise distributions around each dimension
  std::default_random_engine gen;
  std::normal_distribution<double> dist_x(x, std[0]);
  std::normal_distribution<double> dist_y(y, std[1]);
  std::normal_distribution<double> dist_theta(theta, std[2]);
  
  // Initialize each particle based on noisy measurement data
  /* Write to a file in order to post process in Matlab
  std::ofstream outFile("p.m", std::ofstream::out);
   */
  for(int i = 0; i < num_particles; ++i) {
    particles[i].x = dist_x(gen);
    particles[i].y = dist_y(gen);
    particles[i].theta = dist_theta(gen);
    particles[i].id = 0; // No initial information for this parameter
    particles[i].weight = 1.0f; // Redundant with member "weights"
    weights[i] = 1.0f;
    pf_step = 0; // used for keeping track of iteration for post-processing only
	  
    // Visualization for debugging - print all particles
    /* Write to a file in order to post process in Matlab
    if (i == 0){
      outFile << "P{" << pf_step+1 << "} = [" << particles[i].x << ", " << particles[i].y << ", " << particles[i].theta << ";...\n";
    } else if (i == (num_particles - 1)) {
      outFile << particles[i].x << ", " << particles[i].y << ", " << particles[i].theta << "];\n\n";
    } else {
      outFile << particles[i].x << ", " << particles[i].y << ", " << particles[i].theta << ";...\n";
    }
     */
    
  }
  /* Write to a file in order to post process in Matlab
  outFile.close();
   */
  is_initialized = true;

```

## Results

The video below was generated by post-processing data in Matlab.  The size of the particles (blue circles) in the second frame is proportional to the number of times a particular particle appears in the total set.  The larger the particle, the more likely the algorithm considers this position to be correct.
